**STAtistical Mechanics In Network Analysis**

This is a Julia implementation of the approach suggested by Park & Newman (2004) which, in turn, is based on the work of Jaynes (1957, 1957 and 2003).

This code is experimental, under construction and in fact does not yet work for most cases of interest (i.e. with realistically-sized networks or interacting constraints).
